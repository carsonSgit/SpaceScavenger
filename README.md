## Background Information
I developed this game as my Programming 1 Final Project. The original version lacked the lethality of the Space debris and the visual addition of the title-screen ASCII art.

Creating this game for my Programming 1 final project was a turning point where I discovered my passion for coding. The process of immersing myself in solving code bugs, one by one, provided a truly satisfying experience. Please enjoy!
